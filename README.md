# openai_sql_project
This project utilizes OpenAI's capabilities to convert natural language queries into actual SQL queries. It allows users to input queries in plain English, and the system generates the corresponding SQL syntax to interact with a database.
This project demonstrates how to execute SQL queries using SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database. It includes functions to connect to the database, execute queries, and retrieve results efficiently.
